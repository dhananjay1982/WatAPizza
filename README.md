# WatAPizza
 Wat-a-pizza started as a takeaway joint from a small city in India about a year back and soon became very popular in its vicinity for its custom-made vegetarian pizzas. Considering its popularity, the owner of Wat-a-pizza decided to offer home delivery as an option to attract customers who were willing to pay an additional delivery charge. The business of this joint has now grown exponentially. Recently, the owner has started receiving complaints related to mix-up of orders and incorrect billing. To address this problem, the owner wants to move from a manual order intake and billing process to an automated one. She would like the person in charge to be able to take orders and generate bills for all customers automatically. The owner has engaged you to build a system that helps manage the order intake and billing process.
